    - weight: 25
      description: Design Document Requirements Reference
      preemerging: The design document is missing references to several requirements
      beginning: The design document incorporates most requirements
      progressing: The design document incporates all requirements
      proficient: The design document incorporates all requirements in a cross-referenced manner
    - weight: 25
      description: Separation of Concerns
      preemerging: The proposed design does not isolate concerns into software components
      beginning: The proposed design separates requirements into a set of concerns which are mostly captured by a few loosely coupled components
      progressing: The proposed design separates requirements into a set of concerns which are captured by a few loosely coupled components
      proficient: The proposed design separates requirements into a minimal set of concerns which are captured by a few loosely coupled components
    - weight: 25
      description: Data Schema
      preemerging: The data model does not support the proposed software design
      beginning: The data model supports the proposed software design following a major revision
      progressing: The data model supports the proposed software design except for a few minor suggestions
      proficient: The data model is appropriate for the proposed software design
    - weight: 25
      description: Use Case Traces
      preemerging: Use cases or user stories are not traced through the software components
      beginning: Some use cases or user stories are traced through the software components to ensure they are adequately designed and isolated
      progressing: Most use cases or user stories are traced through the software components to ensure they are adequately designed and isolated
      proficient: Each use case or user story is traced through the software components to ensure they are adequately designed and isolated

In your design report, include a summary of your project goals and requirements from the prior reports.

Then, for each requirement, specify a software design (either a microservice, or design pattern) that accomplishes that requirement in a modular, abstract, and/or isolated way.

Each method or microservice should include a list of pre- and post-conditions that will serve as your unit tests and acceptance tests to be discussed later in subsequent plans. List each of these methods within your class or microservice design along with a UML diagram describing each. You should specify which requirements keys each method, class, or microservice accomplishes. If you find that a particular code module attempts to accomplish too many requirements, this may be a sign that you should consider breaking this design into smaller components. Provide a schema for any database or cloud data storage.

Finally, for each requirement, show a flowchart that describes the trace through the services and components of your software system that are exercised by that requirement. Ideally, this will be a relatively small trace for each requirement.
