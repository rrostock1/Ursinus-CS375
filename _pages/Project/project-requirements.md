### Stakeholder-based Design

Before you decide upon your software requirements, it is necessary to obtain input from your stakeholder groups. Prepare a list of questions to ask them that will help you obtain information about their needs.

Keep in mind that their answers will be non-technical, and so your questions should be non-technical in nature. Do not delve into the technical aspects of your project with your stakeholder group. Rather, it will be your job to translate their feedback into technical functional requirements.

Include your stakeholder questions, responses, and your reflections upon their input (for example, how you translated their feedback into requirements) as a section of your report.

### Functional Requirements

To create the software requirements document, begin by establishing a list of numbered functional requirements for your software system.

For each requirement, design a use case or user story. A use case provides a flowchart of user actions that culminates in the completion of the software requirement. A user story is similar but takes the following form:

```
As a <type of user>, I need to <action I need to perform> because <reason this action is necessary>
```

In either case, requirements may depend upon each other. For example, it may not be possible to open a project until the user has logged into the system and obtained a user token. Therefore, the login requirement would be a dependency of the project listing requirement. Because your requirements are numbered, you can cross-reference them in this way.

### Non-Functional Requirements

Finally, identify those non-functional requirements (for example, hardware deployment requirements, network bandwidth, computational power, and so on) for your project.

### Gantt Chart

Include a Gantt chart for your project that schedules each of your sprints. Each sprint should culminate in a prototype or proof-of-concept toward your final project. The Gantt chart should identify dependencies between tasks within each sprint.

### Press Release

Write up a "press release" document that describes your project to the layperson. Show this to at least three people outside of your class project, and validate the feasibility of your project as well as their understanding of its goals and capabilities. Provide and answer a list of frequently asked questions about your project.

### Website

Include your requirements report on the project website.
